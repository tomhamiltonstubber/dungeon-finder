# Dungeon Finder

Dungeon Finder (TBC) will be a web app built by @codetopixels and @tomhamiltonstubber to provide an easy way for Dungeons & Dragons players to match with Game Masters (also known as Dungeon Masters, or DMs for short). Players will be able to view a list of games that have been created by DMs, filterable by a number of different attributes. Players will then be able to rate and review their DM.

This is the frontend app that will communcicate with the API, [dungeon-keeper-api](https://github.com/tomhamiltonstubber/dungeon-finder-api).
